        <p>Are you spending a weekend in Tbilisi and you have already seen =
all the churches and usual touristic sights? Tbilisi is not only about colo=
urful balconies and ancient temples. It is also a crossroads of empires and=
 their urban styles. The most condemned one has of course been Soviet Union=
 and especially its architecture. But we think that even the comunism left =
us some treasures, especially the brutalist buildings built in 70s!
Take this one day tour with an experienced urban explorer and get to know a=
 different layer of our ancient city.
Please keep in mind that this tour takes place only on the weekends.
</p>

<td>Abandoned bath</td>
<td>The baths were built in the 70s, there was a large complex, but some pa=
rt of it has been built much earlier. It was abandoned in the beginning of =
2000s. There were spas for men and women. There were also private rooms. Th=
e reason for the abandonment of this place is unknown.</td>

ems starting from Stalin=E2=80=99s Paining and Lenin=E2=80=99s bust to diff=
erent antique artifact, video &amp; audio cassettes of 90s, cutlery from So=
viet era, old cameras, strange souvenirs, etc.etc.=20

<td>Civil defense bunker</td>
<td>Many people still remember the times when the start of a nuclear war wa=
s an omnipresent threat. Check how was the Soviet Union getting ready for t=
he moment when one of the sides presses the red button.</td>

 After construction it used to supply Digomi and Vashlijvari settlement wit=

<tr>
<td>Abandoned cable car station at Lisi  Nitsubidze</td>
<td>Back then there was a great plan to make the recreational places more a=
ccessible for the population. This  Ropeway was part of it. Opened on 4 Aug=
ust 1978, it connected Nutsubidze street and Lisi Lake. The length of the r=
ope was 1112 meters, the ourney from one station to another took 3-4 minute=
s.
